# Monitoring

My project is based in get data from a temperature/umidity sensor DHT11 with 'Arduino Uno' and plot a living graph with the data with Python.

I can divide this project in 3 steps:

 - [x] Assemble the circuit
 - [x] Program Arduino Uno
 - [x] Get data from python
 - [x] Plot the living graph

And those are the materials:

 - [x] Arduino Uno with USB cable for Arduino (or any other material that allow you to write a code in Arduino)
 - [x] DHT11 (Temperature/Umidity sensor)
 - [x] Protoboard (Optional)
 - [x] Wires/Jumpers
 
## Assembling the circuit
