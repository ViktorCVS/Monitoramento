# Monitoring

My project is based in get data from a temperature/umidity sensor with 'Arduino Uno' and plot a living graph with the data with Python.

I can divide this project in 3 steps:

 - [x] Assemble the circuit
 - [x] Program Arduino Uno
 - [x] Get data from python
 - [x] Plot the living graph

## First step
